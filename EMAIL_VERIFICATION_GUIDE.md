# Email Verification System - Clean City Project

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: WORKING**

The email verification system has been properly implemented with role-based verification requirements.

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **For Residents (Manual Verification Required)**

1. **Registration Process:**
   - User registers at `/register`
   - Account created with `email_verified_at = null`
   - `Registered` event triggered → sends verification email
   - User redirected to `/email/verify` (verification notice)

2. **Verification Email:**
   - Custom template: `resources/views/emails/verify-email.blade.php`
   - Uses `CustomEmailVerificationNotification`
   - Contains signed URL: `/email/verify/{id}/{hash}?expires=...&signature=...`

3. **Verification Process:**
   - User clicks link in email
   - Route validates: role = 'resident', signed URL, hash matches
   - Sets `email_verified_at = now()`
   - Redirects to `/login` with success message

4. **Access Control:**
   - Unverified residents see verification notice
   - Can resend verification email
   - Cannot access resident dashboard until verified

### **For Collectors (Auto-Verified by Admin)**

1. **Creation Process:**
   - Admin creates collector via admin panel
   - `CollectorService::createCollector()` automatically sets `email_verified_at = now()`
   - Collector receives account setup email (NOT verification email)

2. **No Verification Required:**
   - Collectors can login immediately
   - Verification routes reject collector access (403 error)
   - No verification notice or resend options

### **For Admin (No Verification)**

- Admin accounts don't require email verification
- Direct login access

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

- ✅ **Signed URLs**: Prevents tampering with verification links
- ✅ **Time-based expiration**: Links expire after 60 minutes
- ✅ **Hash validation**: Email hash must match user's email
- ✅ **Role-based access**: Only residents can use verification routes
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: Throttled verification requests (6 per minute)

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test Resident Verification:**
```bash
1. Register at /register with new email
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click link → should redirect to /login with success
4. Login → should access /resident/dashboard without issues
```

### **Test Collector Creation:**
```bash
1. Admin creates collector via admin panel
2. Check collector's email_verified_at is set automatically
3. Collector receives account email (no verification required)
4. Collector can login immediately
```

### **Test Error Handling:**
```bash
1. Try accessing verification with collector account → 403 error
2. Try invalid/expired verification link → 403 error
3. Try accessing resident dashboard without verification → redirect to notice
```

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables:**
```env
APP_URL=http://localhost/CleanCity    # Must match actual URL
APP_KEY=base64:...                    # Required for signed URLs
MAIL_*=...                           # SMTP configuration for emails
```

### **User Model Requirements:**
```php
class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
{
    // Custom verification notification
    public function sendEmailVerificationNotification() {
        $this->notify(new CustomEmailVerificationNotification);
    }
}
```

## 🔧 **Route Definitions**

### **Verification Routes:**
```php
// Verification link (residents only, signed)
GET /email/verify/{id}/{hash} → verification.verify

// Verification notice (residents only)
GET /email/verify → verification.notice

// Resend verification (residents only, throttled)
POST /email/verification-notification → verification.send
```

## 📊 **Database Schema**

```sql
users table:
- email_verified_at (timestamp, nullable)
- role (enum: 'resident', 'collector', 'admin')

Residents: email_verified_at = null initially, set after verification
Collectors: email_verified_at = now() when created by admin  
Admins: email_verified_at = now() (no verification required)
```

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

- ✅ Route caching works (no conflicts)
- ✅ Role-based verification enforced
- ✅ Signed URLs validated properly
- ✅ Custom email templates working
- ✅ Auto-verification for admin-created accounts
- ✅ Proper redirects and error handling
