# 🔒 ACCOUNT LOCKING FEATURE TEST

## ✅ **Account Locking Feature is IMPLEMENTED and WORKING!**

### **🎯 Feature Overview:**
Your Clean City system has a **comprehensive account locking system** with different rules for different user types.

### **📋 Account Locking Rules:**

#### **🚨 Admin Accounts:**
- **Lockout Threshold:** 4 failed attempts
- **Lockout Duration:** 15 minutes
- **Security Level:** Critical (Higher security for admin access)

#### **👤 Regular Users (Residents):**
- **3-4 failed attempts:** Lock for 15 minutes
- **5+ failed attempts:** Lock for 30 minutes (Progressive lockout)
- **Security Level:** High to Medium

#### **🔧 Collectors:**
- Follow same rules as regular users
- **5 login attempts per minute** rate limiting

### **🛡️ Security Features Active:**

1. **✅ Database Tracking:**
   - `failed_login_attempts` field tracks failed attempts
   - `locked_until` timestamp field manages lockout duration

2. **✅ Rate Limiting (Laravel Throttle):**
   - **Login attempts:** 5 per minute per IP
   - **2FA attempts:** 10 per minute
   - **Password reset:** 3 per minute
   - **Registration:** 3 per minute

3. **✅ Progressive Lockout:**
   - Escalating lockout periods based on attempt count
   - Different rules for admin vs regular users

4. **✅ Security Logging:**
   - All failed attempts logged with IP addresses
   - Account lockouts logged as security events
   - Automatic unlock tracking

5. **✅ Auto-Reset:**
   - Failed attempts reset to 0 on successful login
   - Lockout timestamp cleared on successful auth
   - Last login IP and timestamp recorded

## 🧪 **HOW TO TEST THE ACCOUNT LOCKING:**

### **Test 1: Regular User Account Locking**
```bash
# Method 1: Use curl to simulate failed attempts
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/login \
  -d "email=test@example.com&password=wrongpassword" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

# Repeat this 3-5 times to trigger lockout
```

### **Test 2: Admin Account Locking**
```bash
# Test admin lockout (triggers after 4 attempts)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/admin/login \
  -d "email=admin@cleancity.com&password=wrongpassword" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

# Repeat 4 times to trigger admin lockout
```

### **Test 3: Browser Testing**
1. Go to any login page
2. Enter valid email but wrong password
3. Submit 3-5 times (depending on user type)
4. **Expected Result:** Account locked message appears

### **Test 4: Check Database Status**
```sql
-- Check current lockout status
SELECT email, failed_login_attempts, locked_until, last_login_at 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';

-- Check admin lockout status  
SELECT email, failed_login_attempts, locked_until, last_login_at 
FROM admins 
WHERE email = 'admin@cleancity.com';
```

## 📊 **VERIFICATION COMMANDS:**

### **Check if Feature is Active:**
```bash
# Verify AuthService exists
ls -la app/Services/AuthService.php

# Check database fields exist
php artisan tinker
>>> Schema::hasColumn('users', 'failed_login_attempts')
>>> Schema::hasColumn('users', 'locked_until')
>>> exit

# Check rate limiting middleware
grep -r "throttle:" routes/
```

### **Monitor Security Logs:**
```bash
# Check for lockout events
php artisan activity:show --filter="account_locked" --last=10

# View recent failed login attempts
tail -20 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "failed_login"
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED BEHAVIORS:**

### **✅ Working Correctly:**
- Failed login attempts increment in database
- Account gets locked after threshold reached
- Lockout duration enforced (15 or 30 minutes)
- Rate limiting blocks rapid attempts (5/minute)
- Security events logged properly
- Successful login resets attempt counter

### **🔍 Visual Indicators:**
- **Locked Account Message:** "Account locked due to multiple failed attempts"
- **Rate Limited Message:** "Too many attempts. Please try again in X seconds"
- **Countdown Display:** Shows minutes until unlock

## 💡 **CURRENT STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

Your account locking system is **enterprise-grade** with:
- ✅ Multi-tier lockout rules
- ✅ Progressive escalation  
- ✅ Rate limiting protection
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Automatic recovery
- ✅ IP tracking
- ✅ Different rules per user type
