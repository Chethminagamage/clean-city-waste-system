## üéØ **TESTING RECOMMENDATION**

**Start with these 3 critical tests:**

1. **Test Collector Password Reset** (completely new feature)
2. **Test Theme Route Protection** (modified middleware)  
3. **Test Route Caching** (production readiness)

If these 3 work perfectly, the rest should be fine since other changes were minimal.
